# **Business Understanding**

An e-commerce company has hired you to collect the recency, frequency and average ticket (RFM) indicators of its customers.

Here is the definition of RFM, by each of its letters:

**R (Recency):** Time since the customer made their last purchase (in days)

**F (Frequency):** Number of purchases made by the customer

**M (Monetary):** Average ticket value spent by the customer, where average ticket = average total spent per order for each customer.

To do this, we will use a database, and with it we will build
Python code that generates an output, also csv, but containing only the customer's
customer identification and RFM metrics.
