**Disclaimer:** This repository contains the challenge 5 of the course Data Science at Escola DNC. You will need to unzip the file 'Data.zip' to get the CSV file used here in this repository. It was necessary to compact it because of the upload size limit.

# **Business Understanding**

An e-commerce company has hired you to collect the recency, frequency and average ticket (RFM) indicators of its customers.

Here is the definition of RFM, by each of its letters:

**R (Recency):** Time since the customer made their last purchase (in days)

**F (Frequency):** Number of purchases made by the customer

**M (Monetary):** Average ticket value spent by the customer, where average ticket = average total spent per order for each customer.

To do this, we will use a database, and with it we will build Python code that generates an output, but containing only the customer's customer identification and RFM metrics.

# About the data

The table contains information on e-commerce purchases in 37 countries, as well as customer identification and purchase data. Here are the dataset columns:

**CustomerID:** Customer identification code

**Description:** Product description

**InvoiceNo:** Invoice code

**StockCode:** Product stock code

**Quantity:** Product quantity

**InvoiceDate:** Billing date (purchase)

**UnitPrice:** Product unit price

**Country:** Country of purchase

# Steps

This challenge is made of 10 steps, which are:

01 - Reading the dataset file and inspecting its data

02 - Missing values in customer identification

03 - Unit prices and quantity of products equal to or less than 0

04 - Verifying if there exists duplicated rows

05 - Assigning Correct Data Types

06 - Treament of Outliers

07 - Data Enrichtment

08 - Obtaining the Last date of Purchase

09 - Plotting graphs

10 - Calculating the RFM Metric
